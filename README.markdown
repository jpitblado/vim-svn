# svn.vim

Some mappings I find specifically useful while editing files from a working
copy of a Subversion repository.

## Installation

I use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
to install Vim plugins.
If you do too, then you can use the following to install this plugin:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/jpitblado/vim-svn.git stata
```

## Future plans

Documentation for the mappings and functions.

Add support for other Subversion subcommands.
Current support is:

	*svn add*
	*svn diff*
	*svn status*
